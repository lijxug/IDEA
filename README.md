# IDEA
Single cell RNA-seq has enabled high-resolution characterization of molecular signatures of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. However, analyses at the transcript isoform level are rarely reported. As alternative splicing is critical to T cell differentiation and activation, here we proposed a computational method named as IDEA to comprehensively detect and annotate differentially used isoforms across cell subtypes.
This repository works as an example to reproduce figures in the [article](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.29.924308).
